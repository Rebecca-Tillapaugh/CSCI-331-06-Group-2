# Project-3   New York City Route Planner

# This program is a New York City Route Planner where ~20-30 major cities in New York State
# are represented as nodes in a graph. The edges between cities will be weighted by actual
# road distances (miles). The heuristic cost for informed search will be the straight-line distance
# between city coordinates. The start node is Rochester (RIT), and the user will choose the destination 
# city. DFS, BFS, IDS, UCS, Greedy Best-First Search, A*, and IDA* search are implemented to find paths
# from Rochester to the chosen destination. For each algorithm, the path cost, number
# of expanded nodes, and runtime are compared, and the algorithm(s) that return optimal solutions are
# identified. A graph drawing with nodes and weighted edges will be developed.
